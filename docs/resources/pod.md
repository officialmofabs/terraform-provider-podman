## Schema

### Optional

- `hostname` (String) Hostname is the pod's hostname. If not set, the name of the pod will be used (if a name was not provided here, the name auto-generated for the pod will be used). This will be used by the infra container and all containers in the pod as long as the UTS namespace is shared.
